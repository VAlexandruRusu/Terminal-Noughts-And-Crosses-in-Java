# Terminal-Noughts-And-Crosses-in-Java
A terminal-based Noughts and Crosses game developed in Java.

Includes the base game logic, random ai, basic ai, imported ruleset from file and multiple game modes (Player vs AI, Player vs Player, AI vs AI). 

Future work: more advanced AI versions, code polishing.

To run: type java xsio (in terminal).

Developed during the first trimester of my first year @ Univ. of Warwick (2017).
